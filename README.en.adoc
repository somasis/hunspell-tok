This repository contains a Toki Pona dictionary for http://hunspell.github.io/[`hunspell(1)`].

You can install this and use it like any other `hunspell(1)` dictionary.

== Installation

* If you want to use this on a browser, check out `make tok.bdic`.
  This target creates a dictionary for Chromium based-browsers.
  To create the dictionary, you need `qwebengine_convert_dict`, which can be found in your
  distribution's `qtwebengine` package, usually.

* `make install [prefix=/usr/local]`. You can look at the `Makefile` to see more variables
  that affect the installation; it's pretty simple.

== Words included

:linku: https://lipu-linku.github.io/

This dictionary contains all the words from {linku}[nimi Linku], with the addition of common
place names, language names, and Toki Pona names.
