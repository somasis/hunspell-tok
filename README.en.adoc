This repository contains a Toki Pona dictionary for http://hunspell.github.io/[`hunspell(1)`].

You can install this and use it like any other `hunspell` dictionary.

== Installation

1. If you want to use this on a browser, check out `make bdic`.
   This target creates a dictionary for Chromium based-browsers.
   To create the dictionary, you need `qwebengine_convert_dict`, which can be found in your
   distribution's `qtwebengine` package, usually.
2. `make install [prefix=/usr/local]`. You can look at the `Makefile` to see more variables
   that affect the installation; it's pretty simple.

== Names included

This dictionary contains all the words from {pu}["lipu pu", or *Toki Pona: The Language of Good*],
by Sonja Lang. The dictionary within the book was explicitly released into the public domain.
